# Essential Media

This is a collection of what I'd like to call my essential reading or viewing. These are blog posts and videos that have stuck with me, sometimes for years, that I constantly send to other people.

If you're discovering any of these for the first time, have something you think I'll like, or just think I'm cool for my list, [contact me!](/) I'd love to hear from you.

## Software

[The Art of Code by Dylan Beattie](https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U)  
Probably the pinnacle of all code-related talks ever. The Art of Code is an hour-long ode to programming as an art form that will leave you a changed engineer. What a wild ride. 

[C++ vs Rust: which is faster?](https://youtu.be/VMpSYJ_7aYM)  
A deceptively simple premise that expands into a rabbit hole about compilers and optimization, all presented in a lovely, digestible way. This was my first taste of many of the things mentioned in the video.

[On the Turing Completeness of PowerPoint](https://youtu.be/uNjxe8ShM-8)  
Can Turing, but PowerPoint? That's all. Go watch the video. It's 5 minutes long.

[Can you fit a whole game into a QR code?](https://youtu.be/ExwqNreocpg)  
A deep dive into the gory details of making tiny executables and MattKC's journey through it.

[Things You Should Never Do, Part I](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)  
A clean slate probably isn't worth the effort when you have Real People to contend with.

[What Color is Your Function?](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)  
Makes you think long and hard about the viral nature of async.

[Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)  
"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses" - *Bjarne Stroustrup*

[The Anatomy Of A Running Program](https://www.rfleury.com/p/demystifying-debuggers-part-2-the)  
A crash course in what a process on your computer even means.

[Joe Duffy's Midori series](https://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/blogging-about-midori/)  
The canonical source of information about Midori, the research language/compiler/OS by Microsoft, which explored some fascinating and extremely ahead of its time ideas about the future of all three.

[How async/await really works](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/how-async-await-really-works/)  
A detailed chronicle on the world of concurrency in .NET until today and how async/await is implemented by the compiler.

## Security

[Breaking "DRM" in Polish trains](https://youtu.be/XrlrbfGZo2k)  
The title says it all. What a premise and what amazing delivery.

[Zenbleed writeup](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html)  
A surprisingly accessible explanation of a critical microcode vulnerability that made me realize how far removed the internal workings of modern CPUs are from their programming interface.

[When you browse Instagram and find former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's passport number](https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram/)  
An incredibly written OSINT journey. The writing style is second to none.

## Science and Engineering

Using analog electronics to make sounds is awesome.

[The Banach-Tarski Paradox](https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA)  
One of Vsauce's most popular videos, for good reason.

[SSC collider series by BobbyBroccoli](https://youtu.be/ivVzGpznw1U)  
A series of videos that dive deep into the interplay of science and politics that led to the failure of America's Superconducting Super Collider.

## Media

[Your colors suck (it's not your fault)](https://youtu.be/fv-wlo8yVhk)  
Welcome to the insane world of digital color and how to make it perceptual.

[Olympic Pictograms by Linus Boman](https://youtu.be/z2W0s2MP9_w)  
A lovely video on the intersection of art and functionality in a feature of the Olympics I took for granted for so long.

[Segmented Displays by Posy](https://youtu.be/RTB5XhjbgZA)  
A video about esoteric hardware but it's an ART EXPERIENCE.

This is one of the first 'indie web' sites I discovered as a kid. One single guy who's been around since the dawn of the internet with a website dedicated to shoelaces (among so many other things), what could be be better? I have been an Ian Knot user for a decade now.
