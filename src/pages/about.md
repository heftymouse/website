# About me

My name is Nikhil. I am currently 19 years old, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I've spent a lot of time developing apps for Windows. I went deep into the rabbit hole of the modern Windows ecosystem, to use the best of what the platform has to offer in the present day, and I am deeply fascinated by apps that care about UX. Now I find myself wanting to learn more about the software that makes everything else tick (what one might call systems) and the parts of computing that expand into a fractal of depth and complexity.

I'm also interested in Discord bots and the Discord API. It's been a major part of my life since 2020, and is what kickstarted my journey in computing. I've also done some stuff on the web, primarily with Svelte and Astro, and experimented with new web APIs and features. Other than that, I've dipped my toes into iOS/macOS development, Minecraft modding, Rust, C++, and graphics. I also cosplay as a CTF player for my college.

Outside of computing, my preferred genres of music are EDM, French House, and various kinds of rock. Artists-wise, it's probably something along the lines of Daft Punk, Justice, Bonobo, Arctic Monkeys, Tame Impala and The Neighbourhood.

Minecraft is almost certainly the game I've spent the maximum amount of time playing, and it's had a proportional impact on my life. Celeste is one of the first games I completed, and I highly recommend anyone who can to do the same. The soundtrack is incredible too! I also love Half-Life, Portal and Halo.

That's enough about me now. Feel free to make yourself known in the [guestbook](/guestbook)!
