# About me

My name is Nikhil. I am currently 18 years old, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Technology is fascinating, as I'm sure you agree. I love learning about all aspects of computing. However, the specialization I've decided to marry for now is Windows development â€” primarily with C# and WinUI. It's not an especially popular thing to do right now, with Deep Learning trending and web tech having been the staple choice for desktop app development for about a decade now. Regardless, I enjoy the idea of creating a quality user experience that fits with the platform. I want to bring a certain 'macOS native app' vibe (seen in the likes of [Arc](https://arc.net)).

I'm also interested in Discord bots and the Discord API. It's been a major part of my life since 2020, and is what kickstarted my journey in computing. It's been a while since I last did something major with it, but I'm eager to return once I find something interesting to do.

I've also done some stuff on the web, primarily with Svelte and Astro (which is what this website is built with!) Web standards have been evolving very fast, and I enjoy playing with new web APIs and features.

Other than that, I've dipped my toes into iOS/macOS development, Minecraft modding, Rust, C++, and graphics. I want to learn more about them, in addition to low-level/operating system development, infosec, and distributed system design.  
There's an infinite amount of depth to be found in any discipline, and anything can be fascinating if you go into it with the right mindset. Lots of banal things have an incredible amount of engineering behind them (random example: text rendering), and I have immense respect for the people who make the invisible foundations of our world.

Outside of computing, my preferred genres of music are EDM, French House, and various kinds of rock. I listen to a lot of different artists, and my music taste constantly changes, so I can't put a list of artists I listen to here, but it's probably something along the lines of Daft Punk, Justice, Bonobo, Arctic Monkeys, Tame Impala and The Neighbourhood.

Minecraft is almost certainly the game I've spent the maximum amount of time playing, and it's had a proportional impact on my life. Celeste is one of the first games I completed, and I highly recommend anyone who can to do the same. The soundtrack is absolutely banger too! I also love Half-Life, Portal and Halo.

That's enough about me now. Feel free to make yourself known in the [guestbook](/guestbook)!
