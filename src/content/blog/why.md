I have a complicated relationship with writing long-form. I've always tried to avoid it in my life since it's something I've never considered myself to be good at. However, on the rare occasion I do (out of choice, that is), I find myself greatly enjoying the process. I'm usually more productive than I expect myself to be, and sometimes a little proud of the end result :p

I've started to realize this lately, and I want to develop this skill into something I'm confident in. I've always admired people who can write in an engaging way, be it blog posts like this one, technical documentation, or even things we typically consider to be stuffy and full of jargon, like official proposals and specifications. The way in which something is introduced can make or break someone's experience with learning it, and there's a sort of satisfaction in knowing you may have helped create the next generation of \<insert occupation here\>.

That's why I've decided to commit myself to writing occasional blog posts on what I'm doing, what's going on in my life, and sometimes ramblings on stuff I have on my mind. I won't keep a schedule for now, but I'll be actively looking for things to write about, so hopefully there'll be a drip-feed of content on this site. No doubt there's lots of opportunities for content hidden in plain sight.

On that note, if you're reading this, I'd love to know what you think! Please do contact me using the links on the [homepage](/), or leave a message in the [guestbook](/guestbook).
